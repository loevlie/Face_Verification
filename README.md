# Face Verification Using Convolutional Neural Networks
In this project we were tasked to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to design an end-to-end system for face verification.  The system will be given two images as input and will output a score that quantifies the similarity between the faces in these images.  For more information I have linked the Kaggle Competition below:
